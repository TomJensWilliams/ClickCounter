# ClickCounter

This is just a really simple little tool I wanted for something, and it can be accessed [here](https://html-preview.github.io/?url=https://github.com/TomJensWilliams/ClickCounter/blob/main/index.html). I make use of the GitHub project that can be found [here](https://github.com/html-preview/html-preview.github.io) so that the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files found here on GitHub can be viewed as a working webpage.
